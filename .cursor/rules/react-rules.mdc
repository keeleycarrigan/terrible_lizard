- always use arrow functions.
- component prop types should be declared using FC with the component specific props passed to FC as a generic
- context is preferred when any type of prop needs to be passed down further than one child component deep
- context should be separated in the same way that Redux slices would be separated
- always destructure component props inside the body of the component
- always use useCallback for callbacks passed to components
- custom hooks should always be in their own file. one hook per file. they should have an interface that describes the values they return
- prop declaration on components should always be alphabetically sorted
- Jest is the preferred testing platform along with @react-testing-library. Never suggest snapshot testing.
- react should always be the first import when importing react
