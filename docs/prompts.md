```
we are starting a new session working on a monorepo project. check session_status to see what we did last time and where we are picking back up. look at operational_directives to see how we should work and the other documents for overal architecture and development plan
```

```
please update all the proper documents based on operational_directives. focus on adding or updating information and only remove information if it is not true or accurate anymore
```
