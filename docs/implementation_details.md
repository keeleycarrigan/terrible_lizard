# Implementation Details

## Phase 2: Root Configuration Implementation

### Key Implementation Decisions

#### Configuration File Strategy
- **Switched to pnpm**: Initially used npm due to pre-initialization, but successfully migrated to pnpm for better monorepo support
- **Created pnpm-workspace.yaml**: Configured to include apps/*, libs/*, and tools/* packages
- **Eliminated jest.preset.js**: User removed it, likely preferring inline Jest configuration
- **User customizations applied**: 
  - Changed unused-vars from "error" to "warn" in ESLint (more forgiving during development)
  - Reduced printWidth and increased tabWidth to 4 in Prettier (user preference)

#### Plugin Configuration
- **Selected core plugins**: `@nxlv/python` for Python support, `@nx/gradle` for Android
- **Comprehensive web framework support**: Added all major web framework plugins (React, Angular, Next.js, Nest.js)
- **Testing framework coverage**: Added both Cypress and Playwright for E2E testing flexibility

#### Target Defaults and Caching
- **Implemented smart caching**: Added cache configuration for build, test, lint, and docker-build targets
- **Input tracking**: Configured inputs to track file changes and dependencies for cache invalidation
- **Production exclusions**: Set up proper production build exclusions (test files, configs)

### Technical Insights

#### Nx Cloud Integration
- **Pre-configured**: Workspace already had Nx Cloud ID, indicating previous setup
- **Benefits**: Remote caching and distributed task execution ready for future use

#### Language-Specific Configurations

##### Python (`pyproject.toml`)
- **Extended exclusions**: Added `node_modules` and `.nx` to avoid conflicts
- **Comprehensive Ruff rules**: Selected balanced rule set (E, W, F, I, N, UP, B)
- **Coverage configuration**: Set up to track all Python code in `apps/` and `libs/`

##### PHP (`.php-cs-fixer.dist.php`)
- **Extensive rule set**: Implemented comprehensive PSR-12 + Symfony standards
- **Monorepo-aware**: Configured to scan `apps/` and `libs/` directories
- **Performance optimized**: Excluded vendor, cache, and build directories

##### TypeScript (`tsconfig.base.json`)
- **Path mapping strategy**: Used `@terrible-lizard/*` scope for library imports
- **ES2015 target**: Balanced compatibility and modern features
- **Decorator support**: Enabled for framework compatibility

#### ESLint Module Boundaries
- **Scope-based constraints**: Implemented hierarchical dependency rules
- **Tag system**: Set up `scope:shared`, `scope:frontend`, `scope:backend`, `scope:mobile`
- **Buildable enforcement**: Enabled to maintain library boundaries

### Best Practices Applied

1. **Hierarchical Configuration**: Root configs that projects can extend
2. **Consistent Naming**: Used `@terrible-lizard/` scope throughout
3. **Performance Optimizations**: Enabled caching and input tracking
4. **Developer Experience**: Balanced strict rules with practical warnings
5. **Future-Proofing**: Added support for all planned technology stacks

### Gotchas and Considerations

1. **Jest preset removal**: User preference suggests inline configuration approach
2. **Tab width preference**: User prefers 4-space tabs over 2-space standard
3. **Error vs Warning balance**: User prefers warnings for unused variables during development
4. **Package manager**: Successfully migrated to pnpm for better monorepo performance and workspace support

### Next Steps Preparation

The foundation is now ready for:
- Custom Nx generator development in `tools/generators/`
- Library scaffolding with proper type support
- Application scaffolding with Docker integration
- CI/CD pipeline configuration leveraging Nx affected commands
