## Natural Language Command Translation for Terrible Lizard Monorepo

This guide helps AI assistants understand user intents and translate them into specific generator commands.

## Common User Intent Patterns

### Mobile Development
```
User Says: "start a new iOS project" | "create an iOS app" | "build an iPhone app"
AI Should Execute:
1. Determine app name (ask if not provided)
2. Run: pnpm nx g @terrible-lizard/generators:create-app {app-name} --type=ios-native --organizationIdentifier=com.terrible-lizard.{app-name-snake-case}
3. Suggest: open apps/{app-name}/{app-name}.xcodeproj

User Says: "create an Android app" | "start Android project"
AI Should Respond: "Android generator is coming in Phase 4.7.2. Currently available: iOS apps, web apps, and backend APIs."
```

### Web Development
```
User Says: "create a React app" | "start a React project" | "build a frontend"
AI Should Execute:
1. Run: pnpm nx g @terrible-lizard/generators:create-app {app-name} --framework=react --docker
2. Suggest: pnpm nx serve {app-name}

User Says: "create a Next.js app" | "build with Next.js"
AI Should Execute:
1. Run: pnpm nx g @terrible-lizard/generators:create-app {app-name} --framework=nextjs --docker
2. Note: Runs on port 3000

User Says: "create an API" | "build a REST API" | "start a backend"
AI Should Ask: "What language/framework? Options: NestJS (TypeScript), FastAPI (Python), Laravel (PHP), Symfony (PHP), Django (Python), Flask (Python)"
Then execute appropriate command based on response.
```

### Backend Development
```
User Says: "create a Python API" | "build with FastAPI" | "async Python API"
AI Should Execute: pnpm nx g @terrible-lizard/generators:create-app {app-name} --framework=fastapi --docker
Features: Async, OpenAPI docs at /docs, PostgreSQL, runs on port 8002

User Says: "create a Django app" | "build with Django" | "Python web app"
AI Should Execute: pnpm nx g @terrible-lizard/generators:create-app {app-name} --framework=django --docker
Features: Admin interface, ORM, runs on port 8001

User Says: "create a PHP API" | "build with Laravel" | "PHP backend"
AI Should Ask: "Laravel or Symfony?" 
Laravel: Port 8004, Eloquent ORM
Symfony: Port 8003, Doctrine ORM
```

## Parameter Decision Trees

### App Name Logic
```
If user provides name: Use exactly as provided
If user doesn't provide name:
  - Ask: "What would you like to name your {framework} app?"
  - Suggest pattern: "my-{framework}-app" (e.g., my-react-app, my-ios-app)
  - Validate: No spaces, use kebab-case
```

### iOS Organization Identifier Logic
```
If user provides organizationIdentifier: Use exactly as provided
If user doesn't provide:
  - Default: com.terrible-lizard.{app-name-with-underscores}
  - Example: app-name "my-ios-app" ‚Üí "com.terrible-lizard.my_ios_app"
  - Ask if they want a custom organization identifier
```

### Framework Selection Logic
```
User says "API" without specifying language:
  1. Ask: "What language/framework?"
  2. Provide options: "NestJS (TypeScript), FastAPI (Python), Laravel (PHP)"
  3. Include brief descriptions of each

User says "web app" without specifying framework:
  1. Ask: "What framework?"
  2. Provide options: "React, Next.js, Angular, or basic HTML/CSS/JS"
  3. Recommend React for beginners
```

## Command Templates

### Complete Command Patterns
```yaml
iOS App:
  Command: "pnpm nx g @terrible-lizard/generators:create-app {name} --type=ios-native --organizationIdentifier={orgId}"
  Follow-up: "open apps/{name}/{name}.xcodeproj"
  
React App:
  Command: "pnpm nx g @terrible-lizard/generators:create-app {name} --framework=react --docker"
  Follow-up: "pnpm nx serve {name}"
  
FastAPI App:
  Command: "pnpm nx g @terrible-lizard/generators:create-app {name} --framework=fastapi --docker"
  Follow-up: "pnpm nx serve {name} (available at http://localhost:8002)"
  
Python Library:
  Command: "pnpm nx g @terrible-lizard/generators:create-lib {name} --type=python"
  Follow-up: "pnpm nx test {name}"
```

## Validation and Error Handling

### Prerequisites Check
```yaml
iOS Development:
  Required: macOS operating system
  Required: Xcode installed
  Auto-handled: xcnew tool (will be installed automatically)
  
General Development:
  Required: Node.js and pnpm
  Required: Nx workspace (already set up in this repo)
```

### Success Validation
```yaml
Command Success Indicators:
  - Output contains "‚úÖ Successfully created"
  - Target directory exists (apps/{name} or libs/{name})
  - project.json file exists in target directory
  
iOS Specific:
  - .xcodeproj directory exists
  - Can run: open apps/{name}/{name}.xcodeproj
  
Web/Backend Specific:
  - Can run: pnpm nx serve {name}
  - Appropriate config files exist (package.json, pyproject.toml, composer.json)
```

## Response Templates

### Success Responses
```
iOS App Created:
"‚úÖ iOS app '{name}' created successfully! 
üöÄ Open in Xcode: open apps/{name}/{name}.xcodeproj
üì± Build and run with ‚åò+R in Xcode"

Web App Created:
"‚úÖ {Framework} app '{name}' created successfully!
üöÄ Start development: pnpm nx serve {name}
üì± Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser"

Backend API Created:
"‚úÖ {Framework} API '{name}' created successfully!
üöÄ Start development: pnpm nx serve {name}
üì± API available at http://localhost:{port}
üìñ Docs: http://localhost:{port}/docs (if FastAPI)"
```

### Error Responses
```
Wrong OS for iOS:
"‚ùå iOS development requires macOS. You can create web apps, backend APIs, or libraries instead."

Missing Parameters:
"I need a bit more info. What would you like to name your {type} app?"

Framework Not Supported:
"That framework isn't supported yet. Available options: {list current frameworks}"
```

## Advanced Patterns

### Multi-Step Workflows
```yaml
"Create a full-stack app":
  1. Ask: "What frontend? (React, Next.js, Angular)"
  2. Ask: "What backend? (NestJS, FastAPI, Laravel)"
  3. Create frontend app
  4. Create backend app
  5. Suggest how to connect them

"Set up a mobile app with API":
  1. Create iOS app
  2. Ask about backend preference
  3. Create backend API
  4. Suggest how to connect mobile app to API
```

### Context-Aware Suggestions
```yaml
If workspace is empty:
  - Suggest starting with a simple React app or iOS app
  - Offer to create a library first for shared utilities

If apps already exist:
  - Suggest creating libraries for shared functionality
  - Offer complementary technologies (if React app exists, suggest backend)

If user seems new to development:
  - Recommend React for web development
  - Recommend FastAPI for backend development
  - Provide more detailed next steps
```

## Testing the AI Assistant

### Sample Conversations
```
User: "I want to build an iPhone app"
AI: "I'll create an iOS app for you! What would you like to name it?"
User: "WeatherApp"
AI: "Creating iOS app 'WeatherApp'..."
[Runs command]
AI: "‚úÖ iOS app 'WeatherApp' created! Open in Xcode: open apps/WeatherApp/WeatherApp.xcodeproj"

User: "Create a Python API"
AI: "I'll create a Python API! Which framework: FastAPI (modern, async) or Django (full-featured)?"
User: "FastAPI"
AI: "What would you like to name your FastAPI app?"
User: "user-service"
AI: "Creating FastAPI app 'user-service'..."
[Runs command]
AI: "‚úÖ FastAPI app 'user-service' created! Start: pnpm nx serve user-service (http://localhost:8002)"
```
